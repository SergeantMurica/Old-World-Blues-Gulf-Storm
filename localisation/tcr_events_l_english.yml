#TCR National Focus Events
  nf_taskforce.1.t: "Our Mission"
  nf_taskforce.1.d: "Cuba was a chaotic place before the war. Political parties seized power only to be toppled by their rivals, and the communists lurked and schemed behind every corner. They waited to take power and once again threaten the United states. Unable to let it continue, the United States ordered Task Force Cuba to stabilize the island."
  nf_taskforce.1.a: "We ruled with an iron will."
  nf_taskforce.1.b: "We governed with a just resolve."
  nf_taskforce.2.t: "Our Retreat"
  nf_taskforce.2.d: "We had hoped to guide Cuba into a better future, but we failed. War erupted around the world and our men and women were diverted to other front lines, leaving our garrisons undermanned. When Cuba was left mostly untouched by nuclear fire, we misguidedly believed we had escaped the worst.  Once again, the communists rose to overthrow our rule. This time, spread thin and without help from the continent, we were forced to retreat south to Guantanamo Bay."
  nf_taskforce.2.a: "We withdrew quickly to conserve manpower."
  nf_taskforce.2.b: "We fought for every inch until forced to retreat."
  nf_taskforce.3.t: "Our Reconsolidation"
  nf_taskforce.3.d: "With the help from Black Division, a covert ops unit stationed at the Bay, we regrouped and held the line. We fought bravely and endlessly for days, until our salvation came in the form of a radiation storm with a fury that drove all in its way to cover. Our forces were left exhausted, shattered and disorganized. We had little time to rest before more Cubans arrived. This time not for war, but seeking shelter."
  nf_taskforce.3.a: "We welcomed only the best and brightest."
  nf_taskforce.3.b: "We prioritized the youngest and healthiest."
  nf_taskforce.4.t: "A New Mandate"
  nf_taskforce.4.d: "For decades we remained stagnant, hiding from a destroyed world and the terrors that came with it. Our people suffered from radiation, and equipment degraded, and political instability paralyzed us as we began to factionalize. Our covert ops allies became our rivals, and the locals we swore to protect were forced to pick sides. Meanwhile the world outside continued to push us, as various Cuban factions sought to eliminate the last bit of US presence in Cuba. This cannot continue. We came here to bring peace and order to this island, and that is what we will do. One way or another."
  nf_taskforce.4.a: "The American Dream lives with us."
  nf_taskforce.5.t: "Resignation!"
  nf_taskforce.5.d: "“I, Henry James Fisher, after two hundred and twelve years of service to this Army, forty-four of which spent serving as your commanding officer, am announcing my resignation. In light of recent events I have come to the realization that if we remain hidden away from the rest of the world, we will not endure. If we continue down path this Force has been on these past forty-four years we will fall apart. We must return to the business that brought us here, and once again unite this divided and broken land. It is time for me to step down, and let a new commander take the helm.”"
  nf_taskforce.5.a: "It's for the best."
  nf_taskforce.6.t: "The Original Mission"
  nf_taskforce.6.d: "The Black Division covert operations unit was originally assigned to protect a United States black site located deep underneath Guantanamo Bay naval base. While we know the site contained a number of research labs and prisoners, what exactly was being researched below remains a mystery. After the great storm of 2078 the underground labs were sealed, and the research was lost. All that remains accessible now is a secret elevator and staircase leading down to a huge sealed titanium alloy door. With no apparent way to open it manually or enter a code, our top scientists believe that it will only open by some sort of signal from outside the base. We should investigate any other military installations we capture."
  nf_taskforce.6.a: "Should we even open it at all?"
  nf_taskforce.7.t: "Sinister Connections"
  nf_taskforce.7.d: "During the Final Cuban Uprising and the Task Force’s retreat, many among our number resisted the idea of helping any United States military personal at all. They argued that it was better to let our fellow Americans die than risk the exposure of the black site. They even attempted to assassinate the first Black Six. Our official record states that these traitors were executed for connection to a seditious and corrupt organization, but what if there is more to the story? It may not be just a coincidence that base communication with the mainland was lost shortly before their sentences. Some personal in the Division believe this was done to hide our final orders from the US Government."
  nf_taskforce.7.a: "Are we the traitors?"
  nf_taskforce.8.t: "Salvaging the Mahan"
  nf_taskforce.8.d: "Our crew returned today, with more news than we expected. Not only are our engineers confidant in their abilities to streamline our naval production, they also believe that with time and resources they can use the wreck to design a warship in similar fashion. Once we have the industry ready, all we need to do is give the word."
  nf_taskforce.8.a: "Welcome back."
  nf_taskforce.9.t: "Task Force Demands Subjugation!"
  nf_taskforce.9.a: "We must submit."
  nf_taskforce.9.b: "We will never bow to tyrants!"
  nf_taskforce.10.t: "The Ancients Accept Our Demands!"
  nf_taskforce.10.a: "The best possible outcome."
  nf_taskforce.11.t: "The Ancients Reject Our Demands!"
  nf_taskforce.11.a: "War it is then."
  nf_taskforce.12.t: "Task Force Demands Subjugation!"
  nf_taskforce.12.a: "We must submit."
  nf_taskforce.12.b: "We will never bow to tyrants!"
  nf_taskforce.13.t: "The Ancients Accept Our Demands!"
  nf_taskforce.13.a: "The best possible outcome."
  nf_taskforce.14.t: "The Ancients Reject Our Demands!"
  nf_taskforce.14.a: "War it is then."
       
 #TCR Politics: Leadership Conference
  tcr_politics.1.t: "Annual Leadership Conference"
  tcr_politics.1.d: "Every April, Task Force Cuba leadership met to discuss the future of the Task Force as well as what steps need to be taken to ensure our continued existence and meet our goals. For years, this conference has been dominated by High Command officers who have voted to maintain the status quo and focus on internal development, while Black Division officers objected. This year, however, Black Division has significantly more backing among Task Force personal and many believe that Black Division will challenge High Command officers for leadership of the Force."
  tcr_politics.1.a: "Let the games begin."
  tcr_politics.2.t: "Task Force Reports: High Command Wipes Opposition!"
  tcr_politics.2.d: "Dispite Black Division's leadership challenge, High command wins out. It has now been two hundred years after the bombs fell, and High Command has proven yet again that they are very capable of meeting any challenge that comes their way."
  tcr_politics.2.a: "We cannot let them challenge us again."
  tcr_politics.3.t: "Task Force Reports: Black Division Takes Charge!"
  tcr_politics.3.d: "Black Division leadership successfully challenged High Command and current leadership policy yesterday in the Task Force’s annual leadership conference. With Black Division support growing among Task Force personal across the board, both factions issued a joint statement stating that Black Division would be given full command over the reconquest of Cuba. While many High Command officers pledged to stay at their posts and assist Black Division, several other officers chose to submit resignation letters. Many questions concerning the future of the Task Force remain unclear."
  tcr_politics.3.a: "Our future is at hand!"
  tcr_politics.4.t: "Political Deadlock!"
  tcr_politics.4.d: "After months of lobbying and political maneuvering, neither side seem to have enough support to dislodge the other. Once the dust settles, deep into the night, a conclusion is finally reached."
  tcr_politics.4.a: "High Command finally wins out."
  tcr_politics.4.b: "Black Division finally gathers enough support."
