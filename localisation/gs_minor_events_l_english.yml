    nf_cuba.1.d: "Before the bombs fell, we lived in the grip of the American Eagle. In an effort to control the chaos around it, the empire invaded our land and forced us to change our way of life. They ruled for decades, and we were forced to choose between resisting American rule, or complying with it."

    nf_cuba.1.b: "We resisted wherever we could."
    nf_cuba.2.t: "The Revolt"

Others advised a more cautious approach."
    nf_cuba.2.a: "To hell with caution! It’s now or never!"
    nf_cuba.2.b: "Form the reserve. Let others do the dying."
    nf_cuba.3.t: "From the Ashes"

    nf_cuba.3.a: "Only our economy can support our people."
    nf_cuba.3.b: "A strong military is the only way to really be safe."
