  nf_havana.1.t: "The Great Revolt"
  nf_havana.1.d: "Once they cried in unison. Millions of voices together once more against the great oppressor. War may have broken the eagle’s back, but the heroes of old were going to take away its last hold on this land. When atomic fire fell on great cities of their enemies, they rose once more in revolt, pushing the eagle’s solders south. Further and further until their backs were to the ocean. Almost free of the shackles of a tyrant across the sea, they charged. Further on for a future they could call their own for all Cubans. On they went, head long into the might of the storm."
  nf_havana.1.a: "We honor their sacrifice."
  nf_havana.1.b: "We remember their ferocity."
  nf_havana.2.t: "The Coming Storm"
  nf_havana.2.d: "A glowing leviathan of death and destruction washed over our revolt. Though some continued the fight, many sought shelter from the storm, while a few true traitors fled back into the grip of a dying eagle. We thought we could wait it out, but continued. Hours into days as the unity that once bound brothers together melted away, and forged us into something new. When we emerged from the storm, we were a new people. We were survivors in a new unforgiving land. Faced with the battered and bloody remnants of the eagle’s legions to the south, and an uncertain future to the north, our ancestors began their long march home. Back they went, to a Havana free at last. "
  nf_havana.2.a: "Never will we bow again."
  nf_havana.2.b: "United we are powerful."
  nf_havana.3.t: "Edge of Collapse"
  nf_havana.3.d: "The home we returned to was not the same one our ancestors left. Bonds of unity that once held Cuba together against the imperialists had broken down. Our cities and towns closed themselves off to the world. All we had left was our capitol, and the people we swore to protect. Over the decades we would rebuild or city, and begin to trade with other survivors to the east and north, but Cuba has remained fractured for over a century. We will need to reunite Cuba if we are ever to fight off another invasion."
  nf_havana.3.a: "Continued economic expansion helped us restore what was lost."
  nf_havana.3.b: "We prepared ourselves for the war we knew would eventually come."
  nf_havana.4.t: "Our Dear Leader"
  nf_havana.4.d: "As we grew rich, we also grew corrupt. The city assembly that governed us soon grew more interested in exploiting us. Representatives and Chairmen lined their pockets with caps, while abusing the trust of those below them. When we resisted, our “leaders” sent Regional Guard troops into homes to quash it. Eventually, however, this became intolerable to even the military and police. On  February 1st 2231, after the sitting Chairman ordered guard Captain Emanuel Romero crush a demonstration in front of the Havana Assembly building, the Captain instead ordered his men inside and arrested every head of state. When the chairman was brought out in chains, we cheered. And now Emanuel Romero alone rules in Havana, and those that object meet the same fate. "
  nf_havana.4.a: "Whispers fly of dissention among the ranks of even his most loyal."
  nf_havana.4.b: "He is what Havana needs, a firm but powerful hand."
  nf_havana.5.t: "No Confidence Vote"
  nf_havana.5.d: "In a fiery Assembly meeting today, representatives from all over Havana voted in favor of a No Confidence resolution against current Supreme Chairman Emanuel Romero. Declaring that the former Captain no longer spoke for the people of Havana the Citizen’s Assembly voted for his immediate arrest. This led to a long running firefight between military and police loyal Gente Unidas and Romero’s own personal guard. Refusing to be captured, Emanuel Romero was killed in the fighting."
  nf_havana.5.a: "A fine end to the tyrant."
  nf_havana.6.t: "Ramirez's Raids"
  nf_havana.6.d: "After a failed coop attempt from subversives lead by Representative Rodrigo Mendieta in the Civilian Assembly, Supreme Chairman Romero ordered Guard Captain Carlos Ramirez to conduct immediate raids on known Gente Unidas supporters throughout the city. The Assembly itself has been suspended until further notice. Police are asking all citizens to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity and report anyone who has any connection to the criminal organization known as “Gente Unidas”."
  nf_havana.6.a: "Long live Chairman Romero!"
  nf_havana.7.t: "Havana Loyalist Trials"
  nf_havana.7.d: "We captured several of the former "Supreme Chairman's" top lieutenants. Each guilty of a wide variety of crimes against Havana and her people. It is time that we deal with each accordingly."
  nf_havana.7.a: "The city will finally have justice."
  nf_havana.8.t: "The Havana Delegation"
  nf_havana.8.d: "Early this morning, a delegation from Havana arrived requesting a reunification of our people. They say Emmanuel Romero, the man we rebelled against, is now dead. The delegation also made it clear that the government in Havana would take deep offense at any refusal."
  nf_havana.8.a: "We look forward to being brothers in arms once more."
  nf_havana.8.b: "To hell with Havana! We can fight them!"
  nf_havana.9.t: "Memorial Bay Accepts Our Delegation!"
  nf_havana.9.d: "Memorial Bay has accepted our proposal, and has already begun to work with our delegation! Our people will soon be reunited, and not a single drop of blood was shed!"
  nf_havana.9.a: "This is a glorious day!"
  nf_havana.10.t: "Memorial Bay Rejects Our Delegation!"
  nf_havana.10.d: "The people of Memorial Bay have refused our requests for peace and cooperation. They instead chose to insult us and our ideals. If they wish to threaten war against us, we certainly can oblige."
  nf_havana.10.a: "Lets make this as short as possible."
  nf_havana.11.t: "Assistance from Havana?"
  nf_havana.11.d: "A handful of Havanaites have arrived in La Sombra. They bring gifts with them and claim to wish to improve our way of life. Thier only condition be that we allow them to govern over us from Havana. In the background they bring with them several heavily armed men. The threat is clear to our cheiftain. Accept Havana's rule, or fall to her guns."
  nf_havana.11.a: "We cannot fight Havana. We will submit."
  nf_havana.11.b: "Reject their aid! They wont take one inch of River Walker land!"
  nf_havana.12.t: "River Walkers Accept Aid!"
  nf_havana.12.d: "The River Walkers have accepted our offer of aid, and have already sent a representative to Havana! It is time to once again make them a full fledged member of the new Cuban nation! No shots fired."
  nf_havana.12.a: "We are that much closer to reuniting our people."
  nf_havana.13.t: "River Walkers Reject Aid!"
  nf_havana.13.d: "These tribals have rejected our offer of aid! They would rather stand defiant and alone, than allow us to uplift and govern them. They have forgoten their past and their heritage. It's time we remind them."
  nf_havana.13.a: "What are they armed with? Sticks? This should be over quickly."
